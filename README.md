# "Found a kitten, can't keep it"

Odds are you can, just don't know how. Some of the solutions to common problems involve reaching out to the community, but well, you are already reaching out to the community. Some involve division of labor, but, thanks to cats (see below), we have a civilization firmly based on it, so the very idea shouldn't be new. 

The correct formulation is: God, or Nature, sent you a kitten (or an adult cat) in need of help. Let's see what you can do and what others can do to help you.

## Meta: forking and localization

The maintainer's location is **San Angelo, Texas, the United States of America**. I am fully aware of the fact that, due to the size of the city, by stating it I am effectively de-anonymizing myself, but hell, I wish I cared. Issues opened within this repo that involve real-world cat situations may involve direct requests to me within my geographic reach (in simple words, "I am out of dry cat food" is a valid issue if you are located near me). If you fork this repo, I encourage you to change the above location to your city/state/country. Regular pulls and (if you have something to add) pull requests (in simple words: downstream and upstream updates) are welcome then.

Geographically dependent parts of this FAQ will be ***marked as such***.
